# CrimeDetection

It is a Multi-class classification model for predicting the types of crimes. Using big data, I have constructed a multi-class classification model using a Random Forest classifier to predict the type of major crime committed based on time of day, neighborhood, division, year, month, etc. using data sourced from Toronto Police.
